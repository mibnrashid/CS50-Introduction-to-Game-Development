Here is all my progress through this CS50-s-Introduction-to-Game-Development course plus all the original code and lectures

# CS50-s-Introduction-to-Game-Development
Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D and 3D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using frameworks like Unity and LÖVE 2D, as well as languages like Lua and C#. By class’s end, you'll have programmed several of your own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.
